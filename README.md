# Hybrid Generative Model for learning Phrase Reprsentative human like conversation -- Chat_Agent 
*Asian University Machine Learning Camp - Jeju 2018*

# Overview
Basically,many emergency services,service company and ecommerce companies require helplines and people. But the catch here is… 
Emergency disaster /natural disaster requires people to not only assure them help but also to guide them,  pacify them, and at the same 
time provide back-up to the police or doctors with their current locations.  Now can all the police/doctors/people be available all the days for 24hrs???No! It’s not feasible, right? hence, I came up with this solution.How about an AI assistant like google or Alexa.  An AI which could exhibit emotions and can response to **consult as well as console people** with provided service specific answers   along with basic knowledge and intelligence of a human. Now this should pass the turning test of AI i.e. we all know an AI is   the best if it can pass the turning test, that is a human will interact with it not knowing that he is interacting with an AI and gets convinced that he is speaking or chatting to a human.

# Introduction

# Chat Agent?

Design of codes through machine learning’s NLP AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  THAT COULD BE A GENERIC INFORMATION RETRIVAL TO SPECIFIC INFORMATION

Level 1 : generic information retrieval fused with domain specific

Level 2 : generic information retrieval fused with guided information direction

Level 3 : generic information retrieval master artificial intelligence.

# Practical Demand meets solution

Basically, how many emergency services, commercial services, service company and ecommerce companies require helplines and people??? Can they work 24hrs??? 
Let me ask you another question… How many first aid services, emergency services, helplines are there??? There are many, right!! But the catch here is… Emergency disaster /natural disaster requires people to not only assure them help but also to guide them, pacify them, and at the same time provide back-up to the police or doctors with their current locations. 
Now can all the police/doctors/people be available all the days for 24hrs???   No! It’s not feasible, right? hence, I came up with this solution. 

I am not talking about AI dominating world or dominating even jobs of people. But how about an AI assistant like google or Alexa. An AI which could exhibit emotions and can response to consult as well as console people with provided service specific answers along with basic knowledge and intelligence of a human. Now this should pass the turning test of AI i.e. we all know an AI is the best if it can pass the turing test, that is a human will interact with it not knowing that he is interacting with an AI and gets convinced that he is speaking or chatting to a human.

# Motivation

Research on data handling and sql and retrieval
21st century – bigdata and nosql – basically information retrieval – putting data into structured, semi-structured and unstructured  data
World is shifting to new CONCEPTS - a new technology of search and retrieval style of working.

# Goal

Generic information Retrieval Master **Artificial Intelligence**.
