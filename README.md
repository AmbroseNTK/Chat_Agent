# Overview
Basically,many emergency services,service company and ecommerce companies require helplines and people. But the catch here is… 
Emergency disaster /natural disaster requires people to not only assure them help but also to guide them,  pacify them, and at the same 
time provide back-up to the police or doctors with their current locations.  Now can all the police/doctors/people be available all the days for 24hrs???No! It’s not feasible, right? hence, I came up with this solution.How about an AI assistant like google or Alexa.  An AI which could exhibit emotions and can response to consult as well as console people with provided service specific answers   along with basic knowledge and intelligence of a human. Now this should pass the turning test of AI i.e. we all know an AI is   the best if it can pass the turning test, that is a human will interact with it not knowing that he is interacting with an AI and gets convinced that he is speaking or chatting to a human.
