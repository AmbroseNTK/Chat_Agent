#Overview

Basically,many emergency services,service company and ecommerce companies require helplines and people. But the catch here is… 
Emergency disaster /natural disaster requires people to not only assure them help but also to guide them,  pacify them, and at the same 
time provide back-up to the police or doctors with their current locations.  Now can all the police/doctors/people be available all the days
for 24hrs???No! It’s not feasible, right? hence, I came up with this solution.I am not talking about AI dominating world or dominating even
jobs of people. But how about an AI assistant like google or Alexa.  An AI which could exhibit emotions and can response to consult as well
as console people with provided service specific answers   along with basic knowledge and intelligence of a human. 
Now this should pass the turning test of AI i.e. we all know an AI is   the best if it can pass the turning test, that is a human will
interact with it not knowing that he is interacting with an AI   and gets convinced that he is speaking or chatting to a human.
